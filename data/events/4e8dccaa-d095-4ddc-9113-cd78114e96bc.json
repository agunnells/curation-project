On May 4, 1919, Broadwell's body was discovered in the Wheelock garden by a local resident walking through the area. The State of Vermont hired James R. Wood, Jr., of the Wood Detective Agency in Boston - generally considered one of the best detectives in New England - to lead the investigation. Wood eventually set his sites on George Long, a man that Broadwell met at a local brothel in downtown Barre. Long was convicted of Broadwell's murder on October 31, 1919, and sentenced to life imprisonment. "
