VanCour notes that music was crucial for establishing mood within a scene - in fact, many larger radio stations had small orchestral ensembles on hand (115). On the other hand, particular melodies could be used to punctuate conversations between characters or, in some instances, a particular melody was associated with a character as a way to provide further context for their personality (VanCour 115).
